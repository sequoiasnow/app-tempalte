# Simple File Structure

This is a simple project to get started with a client based application using
sass and es6 javascript preprocessor.


To use simply clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/the1codemaster/app-tempalte.git my-project && cd my-project`

Then, to use with your own git account, simply remove the .git/ directory

`rm -rf .git`

If you are not using git, remove the .gitignore file as well

`rm .gitignore`

To start the file simply type `gulp build` then `gulp serve` To watch for
changes and serve files simultaneously use `gulp`

All sass files use an autoprefixer and all javascript uses es6 syntax...
